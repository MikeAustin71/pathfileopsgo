# Running Tests
##### Open a command prompt in this directory (pathfileops) and run the following command:

### `go test -v > xx_tests.txt`

This will generate test results in the "pathfileops" directory.  The tests utilize
some library routines stored in the "appLibs" directory.

## Running Tests with code coverage

First pull down and install the `cover` package.
 
  `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/cover`
  
Next, follow the test execution protocol.  
  
## Test Execution with Code Coverage

 `go test -cover -v > xx_tests.txt`  
     

## Cover Profile

Generate the code coverage detail:

`go test -coverprofile=xx_coverage.out`


The following provides for code coverage display in your
browser. Run this on the command line:

`go tool cover -html=xx_coverage.out`
